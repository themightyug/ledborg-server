About
=====

LedBorg-Server is a simple server written in Vala to provide
network control of an LedBorg add-on for the Raspberry Pi
computer.


Package
=======

The package is split into the shared library component, and the
server application.

To compile server on a Raspberry Pi:
./configure --enable-rpi --enable-server

--enable-rpi enables Raspberry Pi specific compiler flags, to compile
the package with performance enhancing flags tailored for the Pi.
This will almost certainly fail on any other platform!

--enable-server builds the server application as well as the
shared library.


To compile the shared library on other platforms:
./configure --disable-rpi --disable-server

The server application *can* be built on other platforms,
but it's not going to be much use on anything other than
an Ledborg-equipped Raspberry Pi.



Communication
=============

Communication with the server component uses HTTP. Instructions and data are
passed to the server in the URL of a GET request.  Responses include data in
the headers and extra information in the message body.

There are currently three requests you can pass to the server:

	1)	/
		This returns an HTML control panel to control the LedBorg server,
		for using a standard web browser as a client.
		The HTML returned is stored in a file on the server in
		$SYSCONFDIR/ledborg-server/ledborg-server.html
		
	2)	/GetColour/
		This request returns the current colour setting of the LedBorg server.
		The response format is detailed below.
		
	3)	/SetColour/
		This request is used to set the colour. It also returns the colour
		it has been set to, so the client can confirm the request's success.
		This request expects colour parameters in a choice of two formats:
		
		i)	/SetColour/?red=x&green=y&blue=z
			This format allows you to specify the red, green and blue
			brightness channels specifically. Each of the three values
			can be 0 for off, 1 for half-brightness, or 2 for full-brightness.
		
		ii)	/SetColour/?ledborg-colour=xyz
			This format allows you to specify the ledborg colour code as a
			single parameter. Again, x y and z are a single integer digit
			of values 0, 1 or 2.


Response Format
===============

A successful request will return a confirmation of the current colour the
LedBorg is displaying.

The ledborg colour value and equivalent hex HTML colour value are returned
in the HTTP response headers.

The HTTP response body also contains minimal HTML markup to display
a rectangular 'LED' with an 8px black border, 64px by 20px, whose
background-color is set to the HTML equivalent of the LedBorg-colour.

An example response from a /GetColour/ request is shown here:
